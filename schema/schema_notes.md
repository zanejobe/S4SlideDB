Notes:
These schema based on Clare et al 2018

It is recognised that many datasets will not permit some of the metrics above to be measured/derived, hence the list of parameters is likely to be incomplete for many landslides.

It is important, however, that datasets, their originators, source of peer-reviewed publications on the data, and the data type on which measurements/interpretations are based are all referenced appropriately.

Guidance as to the measurement of the morphometrics is provided in the schematics in the paper and in images in this folder.
